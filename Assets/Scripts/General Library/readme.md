# wsoft-general
A repository for scripts created by the WolverineSoft Studio at the University of Michigan that are independent from a specific project.

This is meant to contain all "general-purpose" code, code that can be used independently of it's original project. For instance, the volume sliders created during the development of IO can be used in future projects with little to no modification, as its implementation is not dependent on the project itself. More information can be found in the confluence page.

Here is a description of the projects namespaces:
- Animation: Scripts that help with animations and animation controllers
- Audio: Scripts that are used to interact/interface with Wwise or other Audio functionalities
- Camera: Scripts that are used with cameras, renderers, and Cinemachine
- Combat: Scripts that involves the calculations for damage and death
- Core: Scripts that manages scenes
- Input: Scripts that relate to Rewired or other input interfacing
- Math: Scripts that deal with vectors, layermasks, rotations, and transforms.
- Tools: Various tools that can be used in future projects/semesters
    - AutomatedBuild: A tool that can build the game automatically without using the build settings for various platforms
    - DefaultScene: A tool meant for creating a basic default scene.
- UI: Scripts that relate to the User Interface
- VFX: Scripts that relate to spawning/manipulating VFXs and Shaders
