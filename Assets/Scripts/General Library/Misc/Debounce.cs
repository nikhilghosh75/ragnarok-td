/*
 *  Debounce prevents a function from being invoked within a certain period of time
 *  This prevents callbacks from being called too many times, for example in the event system
 *  where a callback can be fired several times (e.g. Start, Finish) from the same event (e.g. Press).
 * 
 *  This implementation doesn't do any invoking, just provides a boolean check.
